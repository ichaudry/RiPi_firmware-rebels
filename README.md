# RiPi_firmware-rebels
Artificially intelligent car made by interfacing sensors onto a raspberry pi. RiPi is designed to follow a black line and detect obstacles along its path. Upon detection of obstacle the bot with wait for 5 seconds for obstacle to clear, otherwise it will go around the obstacle and merge back onto black line.
